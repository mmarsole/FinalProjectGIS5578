# Mountain Identification
This is a repository for my final project (matching mountain ridgelines to DEM generate viewsheds) for class Programming GIS 5578 (taken Fall of 2022 at the U of M).

## The Big Picture
This project is part of a 'bigger picture'. The End objective is to identify a mountain from an image, given that the image's metadata contains its GPS coordinates. This objective is broken down into the general following steps:

1. Automatically delineate the mountain ridgeline from an image (please see [Mountain-Image-Classification](https://github.com/mmarsole/Mountain-Image-Classification) for previous work on implementing semantic segmentation to delineate Mountains from imagery).  

2. Based on the GPS coordinates associated for each image, generate a 360-degree view ridgeline (this is the expected ridgeline one should see based solely on Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and does not consider objects that could interfere with an observer's view at the designated location for example trees or buildings).

3. Match the delineated ridgeline extracted from the image (see step 1) to the ridgeline generated in step 2 (this involves rescaling the image's ridgeline to generally match the 360-degree ridgeline and then perform interactive test to find the area that the image ridgeline best fits with the 360-degree ridgeline)

4. Once the image ridgeline has been matched to the 360-degree ridgeline, identify the name of the Mountain, based on a spatial query (presumably, once the image's ridgeline is matched to the 360 degree ridgeline, we can located where the 'highest' (maxima) peaks in each of the imageâ€™s ridgeline are located based on their match to the 360 degree ridgeline). 

The code in this repository focuses on steps 2.

## Code Methodology 
#### Here, you can read a more detailed explanation of the process performed for generating a 360-degree view ridgeline. 

1. Extract the GPS data for a given Image. 

Not every image has GPS metadata but if a given image does contain the relevant metadata, the "MetaData-GPS.ipynb" file will extract the GPS metadata for JPG and HEIC images and save it as a csv. 

2. Acquire relevant DEM file (the DEM file has a spatial resolution of 30m and was manually extracted from [USGS Earth Explorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/)).

3. Run "Viewsheds.ipynb" file. 

This file imports the GPS csv generated from "MetaData-GPS.ipynb". It then proceeds to create a shapefile for each image's location that is used to calculate the [viewshed](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/viewshed.htm) ("a computer-generated map or model of the view of an area from a specific vantage point"). With this viewshed we can mask the DEM raster to retain only pixels (and their elevations) that are visible to the observer at each provided location (the image's location). 

Polylines are created radiating from each image location based on points plotted evenly around the minimum bounding geometry that contains the visible viewshed output. These polylines are labeled and identified based on their respective 'Degree' (0 to 360) where North is 0 and polylines degree increase clockwise. Based on a spatial join between these polylines and the visible pixels (a.k.a. visible elevation). For each Polyline, the max elevation pixel is retained, thus enabling us to identify the max elevation at each degree interval in a 360 view. Next we extract the distance (in km) from each max elevation pixel to the image location by clipping the polylines based on their intersection with each 'max' elevation pixel. 

Here's a visualization of the steps executed with "Viewsheds.ipynb":

4. Plotting the 360-degree ridgeline. 

Run "Ridgline_Visuals.ipynb", which plots the ridgeline based on the following equation: h/l = H/L where h is perceived height of an object, l the distance from the 'observer' to the measuring instrument, H is the actual height of the object, and L the distance of the observer from the object. 

Based on this perspective ratio, we can calculate the 'perceived height' of the mountain (h) in a 360-degree view around the observer. Thus, creating a ridgeline that should be visible for each provided location.  
 
## Yet to be Implemented
#### A detailed explanation of the process used for matching the image's ridgeline to the 360-degree generated ridgeline. 

1. Manually delineate the image's ridgeline via the [LabelMe](https://github.com/CSAILVision/LabelMeAnnotationTool) tool. 

The LabelMe tool creates a JSON file that indexes points based on the image's column and row indices. The JSON file is converted to a csv file and then scaled to match the 360-degree measurements (degrees for the x-axis and km for the y-axis). To initialize scaled values, assumptions will be made based on the focal length of the camera for each image and that human eyes have a angle view of 40-60 degrees)

2. Run many iterations by vertically and horizontally 'sliding' the image's ridgeline over the 360-degree ridgeline. 

Once the image's ridgeline has been initially scaled, I can locate the best fit of the image by calculating the area between the two curves (the image's ridgeline and the 360-degree ridgeline). One way to calculate the area is by using the shapely area function for polygon geometry (we can use this function so long as the two 'ridgelines' endpoints are connected to create one polygon). Identify the location where the area between the two ridgelines is smallest.

 ## General Notes
 
 The process used to match image ridgelines to mountains will only work for certain instances. First, the method of matching the image ridgeline to a 360-degree view ridgeline, will Not work for aerial views of mountain topography. This means a image of mountains from a airplane view or an image form the top of the highest peak, will result in no clear ability to distinguish distinct mountains in a ridgeline because this methodology relies on distinguishing mountain from sky, not mountain from other mountains.
